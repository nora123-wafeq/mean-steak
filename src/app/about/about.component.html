      Free APIs may place lower limits on the number of requests allowed within a given period. However, performance should not suffer simply because the API is public.

      Slow API performance hurts user experience and may push users away from your app. If you can’t find a well-performing API that does what you want, you might have to invest in a paid API instead.

      To make your life easier, we’ve rounded up the best free APIs you can use for your projects.
